This directory should contain the banner image used by the README.

Place your banner image here as `banner.png`.

Recommended steps:
1. Resize the image to ~1200px width for best GitHub display (height can vary).
2. Save the file as `banner.png` and drop it into this folder.
3. Commit the image to the repo: `git add assets/banner.png; git commit -m "Add README banner"`

If you want me to create a rasterized header from the colorful ASCII art you supplied, say so and I will generate a PNG and add it here automatically.
